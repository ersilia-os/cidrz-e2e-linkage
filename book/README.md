# Welcome!

## Matching of clinical data made easy

Matching clinical entries from two datasets is an arduous task that requires extensive data curation. We have simplified this, finally.

## Automated steps

The manual process of record linkage has a set of well-defined steps. We have automated all of them.

1. Schema matching
2. Data preprocessing
3. Blocking
4. Comparisons
5. Scoring
6. Evaluation

## Powered with machine learning

We have generated millions and millions of synthetic data points. This means that we have run this pipeline against a large number of scenarios, and we can learn from it. The end-to-end record linkage pipeline works because we have trained machine learning models based that can guide us through the real case scenarios.
